# 🚀 DoorFeed CI/CD with GitHub actions, Docker, ECR and ECS.

---

## ✅ PHASE 0: QUICK PROJECT OVERVIEW

---

### 🟩 Problem Statement

> DoorFeed needs a fast, automated CI/CD pipeline to deploy their GitHub-based web app into AWS using container-based deployment.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Push code to `master` → auto build, test, deploy
* Use minimal AWS resources to deploy app
* Avoid Terraform and complex IaC
* Containerize and deploy to **Amazon ECS Fargate**
* Store image in **Amazon ECR**
* Secure secrets in **GitHub**

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack Used

| Purpose       | Tool                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| CI/CD         | GitHub Actions       |
| Container     | Docker               |
| Image Hosting | Amazon ECR           |
| App Hosting   | Amazon ECS (Fargate) |
| Secrets       | GitHub Secrets       |

---

# ✅ PHASE 1: AWS SETUP (ECR + ECS Service for Staging)

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Prepare AWS resources manually via Console to save time:

* Create a container image registry (ECR)
* Deploy a staging service on ECS (Fargate)
* Use the default VPC and basic config

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step: Amazon ECR Setup

---

### 1️⃣ Go to AWS Console → ECR → “Create Repository”

* **Repository name:** `doorfeed-app`
* **Visibility:** Private
* Click ✅ **Create repository**

📌 **Note the ECR URI**, e.g.:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/doorfeed-app
```

You’ll save this as a GitHub Secret in the next phase.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Amazon ECS (Fargate) Setup (STAGING)

---

### 2️⃣ Create ECS Cluster (Default)

* AWS Console → ECS → Clusters
* Click **Create Cluster**
* Choose **“Networking only (Fargate)”**
* Name it: `doorfeed-cluster`
* ✅ Default VPC is fine
* Click **Create**

---

### 3️⃣ Create ECS Task Definition

* ECS → Task Definitions → **Create new task definition**
* **Launch type:** Fargate
* **Name:** `doorfeed-task`
* **Task role:** `ecsTaskExecutionRole` (use default)
* **Container name:** `doorfeed`
* **Image URI:** `<ECR Repo URL>:latest` For Example: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/doorfeed-app:latest`
* **Port mapping:** `80`
* Click **Create**

---

### 4️⃣ Create ECS Service

* ECS → Services → **Create**
* Cluster: `doorfeed-cluster`
* Launch type: **Fargate**
* Task definition: `doorfeed-task`
* **Service name:** `doorfeed-staging`
* Number of tasks: 1
* Select **Default VPC**
* Pick **2 subnets**
* Enable **Auto-assign public IP**
* Create new Security Group:

  * Allow HTTP (port 80) from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
* Click **Create Service**

✅ ECS Fargate service is now ready to be updated by GitHub Actions.

🧠 Notes:

* You can access the app later via **Public IP** of the running task or ALB (if added)

---

# ✅ PHASE 2: GITHUB REPO + SECRETS SETUP

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Connect your GitHub Actions workflow with AWS by storing sensitive credentials and values as GitHub Secrets.

---

## 🧱 Required GitHub Repository

Use any **Node.js** (or frontend/backend) project. If you don’t have one, create a dummy repo with an `index.js` and `Dockerfile`.

```
https://github.com/kirankumaritth/DoorFeed.git
```
---

## 🔐 Step-by-Step: Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to:
   **GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions → New Repository Secret**

2. Add the following secrets:

| Secret Name             | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | From IAM user (must have access to ECR + ECS)                                       |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM user’s secret key                                                               |
| `AWS_REGION`            | Example: `us-east-1`                                                                |
| `ECR_REPO_URL`          | Your ECR repo URI, e.g. `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/doorfeed-app` |

✅ These secrets will be used by GitHub Actions to:

* Log in to AWS
* Push Docker image to ECR
* Trigger ECS deployment

---

## 📦 Optional: Use Sample App for Quick Testing

If no app is available, use this:

📁 Create a `Dockerfile`

```bash
vi Dockerfile
```

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

📁 Create a `index.js`

```bash
vi index.js
```

```js
const http = require('http');

// Define port from environment or default to 80
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 80;

// Create a simple HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set response header
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

  // Success message for DoorFeed CI/CD deployment
  res.end(`
CI/CD Pipeline Deployment Successful!

Application: DoorFeed Web App
Environment: Staging
Deployment Type: ECS Fargate via GitHub Actions
Status: Running & Healthy

— Deployed with using GitHub Actions + AWS ECS
  `);
});

// Start the server
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`✅ DoorFeed App is live and listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

# ✅ PHASE 3: GITHUB ACTIONS – CI/CD WORKFLOW

---

## 🎯 Goal

> Create a GitHub Actions workflow to:

* Run tests
* Build and push Docker image to ECR
* Force a new deployment on ECS Fargate

---

## 📁 Create Workflow File

📍Path: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml

## ✅ Output Verification

After pushing code to `master` branch:

1. Go to GitHub → Actions → Check workflow status ✅
2. Go to AWS → ECS → `doorfeed-staging` service
3. Under Tasks → Confirm that new task was created
4. Visit the **Public IP** of the running task → You should see:

```
